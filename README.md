# Anime Directory Plus Ultra

## Description

This is Group 4's anime directory app.  It was designed to test our coding skills so far and our ability to collaborate as a group.  We chose to make this app because the subject allowed us to have fun with the content.  

## Installation

Because of an unavoidable cors issue, in order to view the quote on a the live github page, the user needs to first vist this link and request access to the demo server: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo 

## Usage

In order to use the website, the user can put a anime name or genre into the search field.  The search results will yield back the 9 most popular results displayed in cards generated on the main section of the website.  Past result buttons will also generate so the user can quickly search for anything they have searched for in the past.  There is also a clear results button that will clear the local storage search results and main results.  A random quote from anime is generated every time the page reloads.
